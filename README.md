## Project Overview

Coach is a comprehensive fitness application designed to provide personalized workout and diet plans using AI-driven
algorithms. It is built with a modular, monolithic architecture, providing flexibility for potential scalability in the
future. The platform ensures robust security, real-time data synchronization, and seamless integration across mobile and
backend systems.

## Built With

### Backend

The backend of Coach is developed using the following technologies:

| Technology                 | Description                                                                               |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spring Boot                | A powerful framework for building Java-based applications with enterprise-level features. |
| PostgreSQL                 | A relational database used for storing structured data efficiently.                       |
| MongoDB                    | A NoSQL database used for managing unstructured and semi-structured data.                 |
| Redis                      | Used for caching and session management to improve performance.                           |
| JWT & OAuth2               | For securing APIs and user authentication with industry-standard protocols.               |
| Spring Security            | A security framework for configuring and managing authentication and authorization.       |
| RESTful API                | For exposing endpoints and interacting with the mobile and web clients.                   |
| JUnit & Mockito            | For writing unit tests and ensuring the application's stability.                          |
| Domain-Driven Design (DDD) | Aligning the software model with the core business domain.                                |
| Hexagonal Architecture     | Promoting separation of concerns for easier maintainability.                              |

### Mobile

For mobile app development, we are using:

| Technology | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flutter    | For building cross-platform mobile apps for both iOS and Android. |
| Bloc       | State management solution to handle the app's state.              |
| Dart       | The programming language used to build the mobile app.            |

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community!
Please follow the steps from [CONTRIBUTE](./CONTRIBUTE.md) guidelines:

### Code Quality and Style

- Follow consistent code formatting rules.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Use proper naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.

**Bad Example:**
